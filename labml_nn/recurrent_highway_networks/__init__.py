    ## Recurrent Highway Network Cell

    This implements equations $(6) - (9)$.

    $s_d^t = h_d^t \odot g_d^t + s_{d - 1}^t \odot c_d^t$

    where

    \begin{align}
    h_0^t &= \tanh(lin_{hx}(x) + lin_{hs}(s_D^{t-1})) \\
    g_0^t &= \sigma(lin_{gx}(x) + lin_{gs}^1(s_D^{t-1})) \\
    c_0^t &= \sigma(lin_{cx}(x) + lin_{cs}^1(s_D^{t-1}))
    \end{align}

    and for $0 < d < D$

    \begin{align}
    h_d^t &= \tanh(lin_{hs}^d(s_d^t)) \\
    g_d^t &= \sigma(lin_{gs}^d(s_d^t)) \\
    c_d^t &= \sigma(lin_{cs}^d(s_d^t))
    \end{align}

    $\odot$ stands for element-wise multiplication.

    Here we have made a couple of changes to notations from the paper.
    To avoid confusion with time, gate is represented with $g$,
    which was $t$ in the paper.
    To avoid confusion with multiple layers we use $d$ for depth and $D$ for
    total depth instead of $l$ and $L$ from the paper.

    We have also replaced the weight matrices and bias vectors from the equations with
    linear transforms, because that's how the implementation is going to look like.

    We implement weight tying, as described in paper, $c_d^t = 1 - g_d^t$.
