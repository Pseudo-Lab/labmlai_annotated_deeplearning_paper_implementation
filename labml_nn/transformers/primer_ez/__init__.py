# Primer: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of the paper
[Primer: Searching for Efficient Transformers for Language Modeling](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/2109.08668).

The authors do an evolutionary search for transformer architectures.
They name the architecture found using the search Primer (PRIMitives searched transformER).
**Primer EZ** is the architecture with the two most robust modifications in Primer compared to
 the original transformer.
Primer EZ trains a lot faster than the vanilla transformer.

### Squared ReLU

The most effective modification found by the search is using a square ReLU instead of ReLU in
the [position-wise feedforward module](../feed_forward.html).

$$y = {\max(x, 0)}^2$$

### Multi-DConv-Head Attention (MDHA)

The next effective modification is a depth-wise $3 \times 1$ convolution after multi-head projection
 for queries, keys, and values.
The convolution is along the sequence dimension and per channel (depth-wise).
To be clear, if the number of channels in each head is $d_k$ the convolution will have $1 \times 3$
kernels for each of the $d_k$ channels.

[Here is the experiment code](experiment.html), for Primer EZ.
