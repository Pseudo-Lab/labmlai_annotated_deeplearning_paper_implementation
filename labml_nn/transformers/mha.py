# Multi-Headed Attention (MHA)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/blob/master/labml_nn/transformers/basic/autoregressive_experiment.ipynb)

This is a tutorial/implementation of multi-headed attention
from paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1706.03762)
in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
The implementation is inspired from [Annotated Transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html).

Here is the [training code](basic/autoregressive_experiment.html) that uses a basic transformer
with MHA for NLP auto-regression.

[Here is an experiment implementation](basic/autoregressive_experiment.html) that trains a simple transformer.

    ## Multi-Head Attention Module

    This computes scaled multi-headed attention for given `query`, `key` and `value` vectors.

    $$\mathop{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \underset{seq}{\mathop{softmax}}\Bigg(\frac{Q K^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\Bigg)V$$

    In simple terms, it finds keys that matches the query, and gets the values of
     those keys.

    It uses dot-product of query and key as the indicator of how matching they are.
    Before taking the $softmax$ the dot-products are scaled by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$.
    This is done to avoid large dot-product values causing softmax to
    give very small gradients when $d_k$ is large.

    Softmax is calculated along the axis of of the sequence (or time).
