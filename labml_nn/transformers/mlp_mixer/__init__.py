# MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of the paper
[MLP-Mixer: An all-MLP Architecture for Vision](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/2105.01601).

This paper applies the model on vision tasks.
The model is similar to a transformer with attention layer being replaced by a MLP
that is applied across the patches (or tokens in case of a NLP task).

Our implementation of MLP Mixer is a drop in replacement for the [self-attention layer](../mha.html)
in [our transformer implementation](../models.html).
So it's just a couple of lines of code, transposing the tensor to apply the MLP
across the sequence dimension.

Although the paper applied MLP Mixer on vision tasks,
we tried it on a [masked language model](../mlm/index.html).
[Here is the experiment code](experiment.html).

    This module is a drop-in replacement for [self-attention layer](../mha.html).
    It transposes the input tensor before feeding it to the MLP and transposes back,
    so that the MLP is applied across the sequence dimension (across tokens or image patches) instead
    of the feature dimension.
