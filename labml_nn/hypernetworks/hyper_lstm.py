# HyperNetworks - HyperLSTM

We have implemented HyperLSTM introduced in paper
[HyperNetworks](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1609.09106), with annotations
using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
[This blog post](https://blog.otoro.net/2016/09/28/hyper-networks/)
by David Ha gives a good explanation of HyperNetworks.

We have an experiment that trains a HyperLSTM to predict text on Shakespeare dataset.
Here's the link to code: [`experiment.py`](experiment.html)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/labmlai/annotated_deep_learning_paper_implementations/blob/master/labml_nn/hypernetworks/experiment.ipynb)

HyperNetworks use a smaller network to generate weights of a larger network.
There are two variants: static hyper-networks and dynamic hyper-networks.
Static HyperNetworks have smaller networks that generate weights (kernels)
of a convolutional network. Dynamic HyperNetworks generate parameters of a
recurrent neural network
for each step. This is an implementation of the latter.

## Dynamic HyperNetworks
In a RNN the parameters stay constant for each step.
Dynamic HyperNetworks generate different parameters for each step.
HyperLSTM has the structure of a LSTM but the parameters of
each step are changed by a smaller LSTM network.

In the basic form, a Dynamic HyperNetwork has a smaller recurrent network that generates
a feature vector corresponding to each parameter tensor of the larger recurrent network.
Let's say the larger network has some parameter $\textcolor{cyan}{W_h}$ the smaller network generates a feature
vector $z_h$ and we dynamically compute $\textcolor{cyan}{W_h}$ as a linear transformation of $z_h$.
For instance $\textcolor{cyan}{W_h} =  \langle W_{hz}, z_h \rangle$ where
$W_{hz}$ is a 3-d tensor parameter and $\langle . \rangle$ is a tensor-vector multiplication.
$z_h$ is usually a linear transformation of the output of the smaller recurrent network.

### Weight scaling instead of computing

Large recurrent networks have large dynamically computed parameters.
These are calculated using linear transformation of feature vector $z$.
And this transformation requires an even larger weight tensor.
That is, when $\textcolor{cyan}{W_h}$ has shape $N_h \times N_h$,
$W_{hz}$ will be $N_h \times N_h \times N_z$.

To overcome this, we compute the weight parameters of the recurrent network by
dynamically scaling each row of a matrix of same size.

\begin{align}
d(z) = W_{hz} z_h \\
\\
\textcolor{cyan}{W_h} =
\begin{pmatrix}
d_0(z) W_{hd_0} \\
d_1(z) W_{hd_1} \\
... \\
d_{N_h}(z) W_{hd_{N_h}} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}

where $W_{hd}$ is a $N_h \times N_h$ parameter matrix.

We can further optimize this when we compute $\textcolor{cyan}{W_h} h$,
as
$$\textcolor{lightgreen}{d(z) \odot (W_{hd} h)}$$
where $\odot$ stands for element-wise multiplication.

    For HyperLSTM the smaller network and the larger network both have the LSTM structure.

        `input_size` is the size of the input $x_t$,
        `hidden_size` is the size of the LSTM, and
        `hyper_size` is the size of the smaller LSTM that alters the weights of the larger outer LSTM.
        `n_z` is the size of the feature vectors used to alter the LSTM weights.

        We use the output of the smaller LSTM to compute $z_h^{i,f,g,o}$, $z_x^{i,f,g,o}$ and
        $z_b^{i,f,g,o}$ using linear transformations.
        We calculate $d_h^{i,f,g,o}(z_h^{i,f,g,o})$, $d_x^{i,f,g,o}(z_x^{i,f,g,o})$, and
        $d_b^{i,f,g,o}(z_b^{i,f,g,o})$ from these, using linear transformations again.
        These are then used to scale the rows of weight and bias tensors of the main LSTM.

        📝 Since the computation of $z$ and $d$ are two sequential linear transformations
        these can be combined into a single linear transformation.
        However we've implemented this separately so that it matches with the description
        in the paper.
