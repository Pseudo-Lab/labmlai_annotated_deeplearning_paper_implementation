# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition (ResNet)

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of the paper
[Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1512.03385).

ResNets train layers as residual functions to overcome the
*degradation problem*.
The degradation problem is the accuracy of deep neural networks degrading when
the number of layers becomes very high.
The accuracy increases as the number of layers increase, then saturates,
and then starts to degrade.

The paper argues that deeper models should perform at least as well as shallower
models because the extra layers can just learn to perform an identity mapping.

## Residual Learning

If $\mathcal{H}(x)$ is the mapping that needs to be learned by a few layers,
they train the residual function

$$\mathcal{F}(x) = \mathcal{H}(x) - x$$

instead. And the original function becomes $\mathcal{F}(x) + x$.

In this case, learning identity mapping for $\mathcal{H}(x)$ is
equivalent to learning $\mathcal{F}(x)$ to be $0$, which is easier to
learn.

In the parameterized form this can be written as,

$$\mathcal{F}(x, \{W_i\}) + x$$

and when the feature map sizes of $\mathcal{F}(x, {W_i})$ and $x$ are different
the paper suggests doing a linear projection, with learned weights $W_s$.

$$\mathcal{F}(x, \{W_i\}) + W_s x$$

Paper experimented with zero padding instead of linear projections and found linear projections
to work better. Also when the feature map sizes match they found identity mapping
to be better than linear projections.

$\mathcal{F}$ should have more than one layer, otherwise the sum $\mathcal{F}(x, \{W_i\}) + W_s x$
also won't have non-linearities and will be like a linear layer.

Here is [the training code](experiment.html) for training a ResNet on CIFAR-10.
