    ## Long Short-Term Memory Cell

    LSTM Cell computes $c$, and $h$. $c$ is like the long-term memory,
    and $h$ is like the short term memory.
    We use the input $x$ and $h$ to update the long term memory.
    In the update, some features of $c$ are cleared with a forget gate $f$,
    and some features $i$ are added through a gate $g$.

    The new short term memory is the $\tanh$ of the long-term memory
    multiplied by the output gate $o$.

    Note that the cell doesn't look at long term memory $c$ when doing the update. It only modifies it.
    Also $c$ never goes through a linear transformation.
    This is what solves vanishing and exploding gradients.

    Here's the update rule.

    \begin{align}
    c_t &= \sigma(f_t) \odot c_{t-1} + \sigma(i_t) \odot \tanh(g_t) \\
    h_t &= \sigma(o_t) \odot \tanh(c_t)
    \end{align}

    $\odot$ stands for element-wise multiplication.

    Intermediate values and gates are computed as linear transformations of the hidden
    state and input.

    \begin{align}
    i_t &= lin_x^i(x_t) + lin_h^i(h_{t-1}) \\
    f_t &= lin_x^f(x_t) + lin_h^f(h_{t-1}) \\
    g_t &= lin_x^g(x_t) + lin_h^g(h_{t-1}) \\
    o_t &= lin_x^o(x_t) + lin_h^o(h_{t-1})
    \end{align}
