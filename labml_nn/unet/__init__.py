# U-Net

This is an implementation of the U-Net model from the paper,
[U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1505.04597).

U-Net consists of a contracting path and an expansive path.
The contracting path is a series of convolutional layers and pooling layers,
where the resolution of the feature map gets progressively reduced.
Expansive path is a series of up-sampling layers and convolutional layers
where the resolution of the feature map gets progressively increased.

At every step in the expansive path the corresponding feature map from the contracting path
concatenated with the current feature map.

Here is the [training code](experiment.html) for an experiment that trains a U-Net
on [Carvana dataset](carvana.html).
