# PonderNet: Learning to Ponder

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of the paper
[PonderNet: Learning to Ponder](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/2107.05407).

PonderNet adapts the computation based on the input.
It changes the number of steps to take on a recurrent network based on the input.
PonderNet learns this with end-to-end gradient descent.

PonderNet has a step function of the form

$$\hat{y}_n, h_{n+1}, \lambda_n = s(x, h_n)$$

where $x$ is the input, $h_n$ is the state, $\hat{y}_n$ is the prediction at step $n$,
and $\lambda_n$ is the probability of halting (stopping) at current step.

$s$ can be any neural network (e.g. LSTM, MLP, GRU, Attention layer).

The unconditioned probability of halting at step $n$ is then,

$$p_n = \lambda_n \prod_{j=1}^{n-1} (1 - \lambda_j)$$

That is the probability of not being halted at any of the previous steps and halting at step $n$.

During inference, we halt by sampling based on the halting probability $\lambda_n$
 and get the prediction at the halting layer $\hat{y}_n$ as the final output.

During training, we get the predictions from all the layers and calculate the losses for each of them.
And then take the weighted average of the losses based on the probabilities of getting halted at each layer
$p_n$.

The step function is applied to a maximum number of steps donated by $N$.

The overall loss of PonderNet is

\begin{align}
L &= L_{Rec} + \beta L_{Reg} \\
L_{Rec} &= \sum_{n=1}^N p_n \mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y}_n) \\
L_{Reg} &= \mathop{KL} \Big(p_n \Vert p_G(\lambda_p) \Big)
\end{align}

$\mathcal{L}$ is the normal loss function between target $y$ and prediction $\hat{y}_n$.

$\mathop{KL}$ is the [Kullback–Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence).

$p_G$ is the [Geometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution) parameterized by
$\lambda_p$. *$\lambda_p$ has nothing to do with $\lambda_n$; we are just sticking to same notation as the paper*.
$$Pr_{p_G(\lambda_p)}(X = k) = (1 - \lambda_p)^k \lambda_p$$.

The regularization loss biases the network towards taking $\frac{1}{\lambda_p}$ steps and incentivizes
 non-zero probabilities for all steps; i.e. promotes exploration.

Here is the [training code `experiment.py`](experiment.html) to train a PonderNet on [Parity Task](../parity.html).
