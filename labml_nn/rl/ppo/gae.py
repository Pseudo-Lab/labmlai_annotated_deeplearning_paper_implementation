# Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of paper
[Generalized Advantage Estimation](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1506.02438).

You can find an experiment that uses it [here](experiment.html).

        \begin{align}
        \hat{A_t^{(1)}} &= r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s)
        \\
        \hat{A_t^{(2)}} &= r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} +\gamma^2 V(s_{t+2}) - V(s)

        \hat{A_t^{(\infty)}} &= r_t + \gamma r_{t+1} +\gamma^2 r_{t+1} + ... - V(s)
        \end{align}

        $\hat{A_t^{(1)}}$ is high bias, low variance, whilst
        $\hat{A_t^{(\infty)}}$ is unbiased, high variance.

        We take a weighted average of $\hat{A_t^{(k)}}$ to balance bias and variance.
        This is called Generalized Advantage Estimation.
        $$\hat{A_t} = \hat{A_t^{GAE}} = \sum_k w_k \hat{A_t^{(k)}}$$
        We set $w_k = \lambda^{k-1}$, this gives clean calculation for
        $\hat{A_t}$

        \delta_t &= r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)

        \\
        &= \delta_t + \gamma \lambda \hat{A_{t+1}}
