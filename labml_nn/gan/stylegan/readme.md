# [StyleGAN 2](https://nn.labml.ai/gan/stylegan/index.html)

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of the paper
 [Analyzing and Improving the Image Quality of StyleGAN](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1912.04958)
 which introduces **StyleGAN2**.
StyleGAN 2 is an improvement over **StyleGAN** from the paper
 [A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1812.04948).
And StyleGAN is based on **Progressive GAN** from the paper
 [Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1710.10196).
All three papers are from the same authors from [NVIDIA AI](https://twitter.com/NVIDIAAI).
