 A PyTorch implementation/tutorial of Batch-Channel Normalization.

# Batch-Channel Normalization

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of Batch-Channel Normalization from the paper
 [Micro-Batch Training with Batch-Channel Normalization and Weight Standardization](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1903.10520).
We also have an [annotated implementation of Weight Standardization](../weight_standardization/index.html).

Batch-Channel Normalization performs batch normalization followed
by a channel normalization (similar to a [Group Normalization](../group_norm/index.html).
When the batch size is small a running mean and variance is used for
batch normalization.

Here is [the training code](../weight_standardization/experiment.html) for training
a VGG network that uses weight standardization to classify CIFAR-10 data.
