# [Weight Standardization](https://nn.labml.ai/normalization/weight_standardization/index.html)

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of Weight Standardization from the paper
 [Micro-Batch Training with Batch-Channel Normalization and Weight Standardization](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1903.10520).
We also have an
[annotated implementation of Batch-Channel Normalization](https://nn.labml.ai/normalization/batch_channel_norm/index.html).
