# Layer Normalization

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of
[Layer Normalization](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1607.06450).

### Limitations of [Batch Normalization](../batch_norm/index.html)

* You need to maintain running means.
* Tricky for RNNs. Do you need different normalizations for each step?
* Doesn't work with small batch sizes;
large NLP models are usually trained with small batch sizes.
* Need to compute means and variances across devices in distributed training.

## Layer Normalization

Layer normalization is a simpler normalization method that works
on a wider range of settings.
Layer normalization transforms the inputs to have zero mean and unit variance
across the features.
*Note that batch normalization fixes the zero mean and unit variance for each element.*
Layer normalization does it for each batch across all elements.

Layer normalization is generally used for NLP tasks.

We have used layer normalization in most of the
[transformer implementations](../../transformers/gpt/index.html).

    ## Layer Normalization

    Layer normalization $\text{LN}$ normalizes the input $X$ as follows:

    When input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times C}$ is a batch of embeddings,
    where $B$ is the batch size and $C$ is the number of features.
    $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{C}$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{C}$.
    $$\text{LN}(X) = \gamma
    \frac{X - \underset{C}{\mathbb{E}}[X]}{\sqrt{\underset{C}{Var}[X] + \epsilon}}
    + \beta$$

    When input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times B \times C}$ is a batch of a sequence of embeddings,
    where $B$ is the batch size, $C$ is the number of channels, $L$ is the length of the sequence.
    $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{C}$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{C}$.
    $$\text{LN}(X) = \gamma
    \frac{X - \underset{C}{\mathbb{E}}[X]}{\sqrt{\underset{C}{Var}[X] + \epsilon}}
    + \beta$$

    When input $X \in \mathbb{R}^{B \times C \times H \times W}$ is a batch of image representations,
    where $B$ is the batch size, $C$ is the number of channels, $H$ is the height and $W$ is the width.
    This is not a widely used scenario.
    $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H \times W}$ and $\beta \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H \times W}$.
    $$\text{LN}(X) = \gamma
    \frac{X - \underset{C, H, W}{\mathbb{E}}[X]}{\sqrt{\underset{C, H, W}{Var}[X] + \epsilon}}
    + \beta$$
